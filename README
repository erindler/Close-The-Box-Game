Welcome to Close The Box Game

Goal:
"Close the Box" by "closing" all the tiles based on dice rolls

Rules:
1. Roll two die to determine the value you will work with
2. The value of your roll may be divided in any way as long as the sum of all the tiles you "close" equals the value of the roll (i.e. Roll Value: 6;
Possible Combinations: [1,2,3] [4,2] [5,1] [6]
3. If you roll doubles(both dice show the same value) then the number you rolled two of may be used in the turn (i.e. Roll: Dice 1 = 6 Dice 2 = 6;
Then you may "close" the tile 6 for that roll

Have fun and close that box!
